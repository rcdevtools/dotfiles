# Awklesses' Dotfiles

This repository contains all my personal dotfile configurations for various
pieces of software that I use. It is _not_ recommended to blindly copy and paste
any code you see here __without__ first understanding what it does and how.
Remember, this repository exists for my personal use only. This means that
there are settings and configurations in here that I find useful that most
others would probably find nonsensical. Enjoy, but proceed with caution!
