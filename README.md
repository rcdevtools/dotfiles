# Awklesses' Dotfiles

This repository contains all my personal dotfile configurations for various
pieces of software that I use. It is _not_ recommended to blindly copy and paste
any code you see here __without__ first understanding what it does and how.
Remember, this repository exists for my personal use only. This means that
there are settings and configurations in here that I find useful that most
others would probably find nonsensical. Enjoy, but proceed with caution!

## Contributing

Even though repository exists for my personal use, it is open to the following
forms of contribution:

1. Bug reports.
1. Feature requests.
1. Improvements to dotfile configurations.
1. Improvements to documentation.
1. Improvements to CI/CD workflow(s).

View the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more information about proper contribution
to this code base. Please do not use the issue tracker as and FAQ.

## License

This repository as a whole is distributed under the MIT license. A copy of this
license is always provided in the `LICENSE.txt` or the `LICENSES/MIT.txt` file.
I also decided to abide by the REUSE v3.0 specification
<https://reuse.software/spec/> to make it clear what portions of the project
belong to what license and who owns the copyright of said portions. This project
takes inspiration from other peoples dotfile configurations, and I felt it would
the the right thing to ensure that they recieve credit for their efforts rather
than blindly taking their code.
