# Contributing

So you want to add something to this messy dotfile collection, eh? Great! Just
remember that the following should be seen as guidelines _not_ steadfast rules.

## Expected Forms of Contribution

Even though repository exists for my personal use, it is open to the following
forms of contribution:

1. Bug reports.
1. Feature requests.
1. Improvements to dotfile configurations.
1. Improvements to documentation.
1. Improvements to CI/CD workflow(s).

There are bug report, feature request, and pull/merge request templates for you
to use for your submissions to the issue tracker. Please do not use the issue
tracker as an FAQ.

## Licensing

This project uses the MIT license for everything. Some portions may be placed
under a different license and copyright information, which will be explicitly
stated with SPDX tags. If you decide to add any new files make sure you add the
appropriate SPDX tag information so that your additions are REUSE v3.0
compliant. See the specification for REUSE v3.0 for more information:
