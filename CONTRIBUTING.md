# Contributing

So you want to add something to this messy dotfile collection, eh? Great! Just
remember that the following should be seen as guidelines _not_ steadfast rules.

## Expected Forms of Contribution

Even though repository exists for my personal use, it is open to the following
forms of contribution:

1. Bug reports.
1. Feature requests.
1. Improvements to dotfile configurations.
1. Improvements to documentation.
1. Improvements to CI/CD workflow(s).

There are bug report, feature request, and pull/merge request templates for you
to use for your submissions to the issue tracker. Please do not use the issue
tracker as an FAQ.
